Most fourplexes built in the area are in the 3600 to 3900 square foot range; however, this building is 4101 square feet due to an excellent design & rear 2nd floor cantilever. There are 3 fourplexes on the 300 block of 22nd St, the other structures both in front and behind are single lot SFRs (which are valued in the $1.75 to $2.5 million range). This building defines a fourplex which is suitable for an “owner-user” who intends to occupy one of the units (full time or as a \"beach close\" second home). High income tenants are naturally drawn to the area by nearby attractions including: The soft sands & ridable waves of Surf City, blufftop park/bike path, Beach Playground, Pier, Main Street Village, restaurants, shopping, entertainment, & numerous events (4th of July parade & fireworks, US Open of Surfing, Pacific Airshow, & more). The building next door 321 22nd Street is also available. This is the first time these properties (317 & 321 22nd St) have been offered for sale in 40 years. They are arguably the best owner user quality buildings that have come on the market in several years.  The mix of units includes (two) 3 BR – 2.5 BA units, (one) 2 BR – 1 Ba unit, and (one) 1BR – 1BA unit. Each 3 bedroom unit has two garage spaces, and there is one garage space each for the other two units (for a total of 6 garage spaces).  There is onsite parking for two additional cars. Built in 1973, and individually metered for gas & electric. The building is only 6 blocks from award winning Elementary & Middle Schools – 10 blocks from Huntington Beach High School (which offers the Academy of Performing Arts and Nationally Ranked athletics programs). Fantastic upside potential - Current rents can be increased significantly to estimated market levels. Contact Listing Agent for rent comparables. Given its proximity to beach, pier, and Main Street Village, this offering represents an attractive opportunity to rehab and substantially increase rental income for the long term income property investor or owner occupant.  The location & two large 3 bedroom “front” units makes these buildings “ideal” for partnerships. Note: 321 22nd Street is a “model match” building with same footprint & floorplans on the same size (50’ X 115’) lot.","PurchaseContractDate":"2024-03-28","RealEstateTaxExpense":null,"ReasonForSelling":null,"RegisteredYN":false,"RentControlYN":false,"RentIncludes":null,"RentMax":null,"RentMin":null,"ReservesExpense":null,"ResidentialSquareFootage":null,"ResidentManagerExpense":null,"RetailCenterType":null,"RetailSquareFootage":null,"RoadFrontageType":["City Street"],"RoadSurfaceType":["Alley Paved","Paved"],"Roof":["Flat"],"RoomBathroomFeatures":null,"RoomKitchenFeatures":null,"RoomType":null,"RVParkingDimensions":null,"RVParkingFee":null,"SaleConsideredYN":null,"SeatingCapacity":null,"SecurityExpense":null,"SecurityFeatures":["Smoke Detector(s)"],"SeniorCommunityYN":false,"SerialU":null,"SerialX":null,"SerialXX":null,"Sewer":["Sewer Paid","Public Sewer"],"ShowingContactName":null,"ShowingContactPhone":null,"ShowingContactPhoneExt":null,"ShowingContactType":["Agent"],"ShowingInstructions":"See the \"Walk Exterior\" 3D tour link in MLS.  \r\n\r\nCo-Listed by: Scot Campbell (CB-Campbell Realtors), Mike Oneil CBRE, and Bruce Reinecke (Solterra).\r\n\r\nPlease do not disturb tenants.  \r\n\r\nOne of the front units is now vacant (we did not lease it so it can be shown to possible owner/occupant).
